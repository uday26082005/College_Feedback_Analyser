# College_Feedback_Analyser

The College Feedback Classifier is an NLP-based project that automatically categorizes open-ended student feedback into predefined themes such as Academics, Facilities, Administration, Hostel, Canteen, and Placement. This enables educational institutions to better understand student concerns and make informed decisions for improvement.
